{"description": "The artwork features a subject with good focus and vibrant colors, but the background is lacking in depth. Shadows appear odd, and the use of white does not enhance the overall composition.", "analysis": "The contrast between the subject and the background is insufficient, leading to a flat visual experience. The shadows disrupt the natural feel of the piece, and the white elements do not contribute meaningfully.", "interpretation": "The artwork could more effectively convey a sense of success and joy if it depicted the subject, presumably a child, wearing a medal with a big grin.

The shadows are a bit odd and the white just doesnt really do much for the overall pic.

Reminds me that most all iconography was commissioned and purposed to glorify god and how that probably isn't the case any more, in this case. Would be interested to know if that was true or not, but I suspect it is."}

The focus and lighting are pretty good.  I guess the thing that throws me off is how exactly are you trying to work the cherries into the \"glam\" image???  I see just the tips of her fingers and part of the left cherry is cut off; both of which is distracting from the glam concept.  I'm thinking maybe you could have included more of her hand and all of the cherries.  Also, the cherry is \"just\" against her lip.  Maybe a more \"seductive\" (adding to the glam concept) way to incorporate the cherries (or maybe just one cherry would have been better) was to have the model pucker her lips against the cherry?  The photo just seems to be missing something...  But what do I know, its just my honest thoughts about the image..."}

The placement of the pins appears to be haphazard, and some have even been partially cropped by the edge of the frame or are partially disappearing into the large black void in the background.  There was probably a better, more creative approach to this subject.  Maybe even arranging the pins in the form of a question mark and composing so that the pin cushion fills the frame.

I do like the subject and the angle presented is interesting but it presented some challenges and some drawbacks. The trombone player remains in the shadows (which I understand was the challenge of the contest) such that more attention is focused on the trombone. The front of the trombone appears as a flat circle with no defining features - if just a little more light could have been shed just on that spot to show the curve of the metal inward to a darker opening where the music bursts forth from, it would have further defined the object as seperate from the head of the player. Not to mention if that spot was illuminated a little more it would give a better sense of depth. Also I would have liked to have seen more distiction in the fingers of the trombone player. They would still be in shadow for this is a shilouette but it would have been nice to see the fingers \"dancing\" upon this instrument as it is played such that it helps invoke the imagery of music played in the viewer's ears."}

The staged nature of the figure and the insufficient blood detail undermine the intended emotional response, suggesting a disconnect between the subject matter and its execution.", "judgment": "Overall, the photograph is rated a 3 due to its strong composition but significant shortcomings in lighting, realism, and emotional engagement.", "image_id": "162403.jpg", "original_comment": "As for the shot itself, nice composition but the lighting leaves a lot to be desired, the dark shadow on the right is very distracting and the set up is just that, too set up, there sould be more blood pooled in the bottom of the shower area, not just one little stream into the drain.  The way she's set up is also very staged, I now she's supposed to be dead but she just looks like she's staring off into space.  Maybe if the eyes were rolled back a little more.  And I would also like to have seen both feet completely in the shot.  A 3, sorry :("}

Also lets the color be itself and not forced at all.  Very well done - underappreciated in the voting I think.  Black background was the only way to go as well...really lets the insulator stand strong and bold.  Nice job Roxanne!"}

Focus and depth of field, are a bit soft.  Were you going for a soft focus effect.  A smaller f-stop will get you more depth of field.

Then I go home and blend the layers in Photoshop CS5.  I use the long exposure as the base and layer the short exposure over it.  I then fade the short exposure shot a little until the light looks good, and use a very soft brush to erase the rest of the short exposure layer.  Flatten the image, and I've usually got a pretty good looking street light.  (IMNSHO  8P)  I've also used it for nocturnal landscapes/seascapes when the moon is blown out."}

Makeup and costume are good, model is very pretty.  Though you were probably aiming for the shadow, a wee bit of fill on the right would soften it just a touch.  (Yeah, I can say stuff like that - have NO idea how to actually shoot or accomplish stuff like that.)  Trying to find a way to keep the shoulder (because I do like it there) but \"tone it down\" a bit - maybe add a bit on the right, as in a wee bit more space?  Vignette the lower left a touch?  Not sure.  Also like how you brought out the eye on the darkish side.  (Sorry about the meandering, but I'm going with what I see as I see it, yes?)  Finally, for DPC it needs to be sharper, crisper - the overall impression is one of softness, but not enough to be intentional softness, if that makes sense.  Anyway, better than what you're getting for it."}

A lot of horses on a small frame chassis does fit the bill of \"not quite right\". From an image standpoint, it might have helped to use a longer view or conversely a short view to increase the impact of the image in terms of \"power\", but it works as it is."}

I especially like how the color really fades out to white on the upper left.  Does need more curves/contrast but that is an easy fix.  Nice work."}

I think I need to just go with my first impression, which was: \"What am I supposed to be looking at?\"  There is not really a point of focus in this image. The dock poles are in focus, but they are sort of divided up, so my eyes go in two directions. Then there is a seagull that is center stage, but not really occupying enough of the picture in comparison to the poles to keep the eye on that spot. I think the idea was there, but maybe a slightly better composition would have upped the wow factor."}

Different experience, getting the shot vs viewing the result. Like everything else with photography it's all about the light. Most of the time, the results don't transcend the cliche. Perhaps your success with your audience comes from transcending the nude cliche? My favorite in this photo essay is Trauma.

I love the richness of the black, the white is not too bright as to overwhelm, instead it offsets the deep black perfectly.  The composition is great, excellent focus, just a great image all around.  I kind of wish there was some sort of more substantial border just to make it have that finished/framed look, but that's just gravy.  Nicely captured.  I am upping from an 8 to a 9 and adding a favorite."}

Basically, the image met the challenge and you accomplished what you intended for the image but there are issues with composition and quality.  The primary issue is the picture looks out of focus.  This is most likely due to your post processing steps.  I not sure if Microsoft Office Picture Manager has the ability to sharpen images but most images look blurry after resizing.  As for the composition, I'm not sure if shooting this in portrait would have helped any.  The issue is that the dogs looking in opposite directions, which confuses the focus point for this image (do your eyes follow their stare towards the left or towards the right).  I would suggest that next time you have someone hold a treat so that they both look in the same direction and also have them sit so they aren't stacked one on top of the other."}
