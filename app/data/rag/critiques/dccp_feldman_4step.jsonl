As with all old buildings, over time they settle to where no two angles are the same.  You just have to choose 1 that works best.  In This case the choice I would make is the corner where the blue and orange facades meet because of its strengthe.  The building as it is, is heavily weighted to the left of the image so it appears to be listing.  Just by rotating the image a tiny bit, it will regain its balance.  The rest of the composition is very good.  I really like the ambiance."}

You might want to think about shooting at a larger aperture size next time, so that more of the background is in bokeh (more is blurry).  This usually makes the subject pop out of the picture in a beautiful way.  Unless they work really well or are a very important part of the picture, cluttered backgrounds can be a bit distracting.  Also try making your subject a bit off-centre in the frame, as it tends to add much interest.  Search for \"rule of thirds\" on Google to learn what makes a very pleasing composition.

The Micro Nikkor is the right lens for this shot, and you have found a subject that fits it's abilities very well. Excellent focus, and shallow DOF at this range make this a very pleasing image.  I reach for my Micro Nikkor 55 manual focus when things seem to be getting dull, and the boredom is always gone in just a few minutes.  It always impresses me that the lens can see things that I certainly can't with my eyes, like the little hook claws on the ends of the bee's legs."}

For example, the lower portion of the frame shows a nice straight line that matches the frame, but the lines at the top of the building seem a bit distorted. This has the effect for me of skewing the entire composition in a distracting way. You have also elected to frame or crop the image in such a way that cuts out what looks to be an interesting structure at top, but your crop has left in a distracting element at extreme upper left. This is incongruous, to me, with the formal style of capturing the six windows in a very regular pattern."}

I like how you have his vibrant colors juxtaposed against the rather dreariness of the buildings and hillside behind him.  Though I'm not familiar with Amber Ft Keeper...I assumed it was in India.  Your image makes me think of how even though India struggles with poverty, it's people over come and are quite happy with their daily lives, lives filled with celebration and costume."}

Two you probably lost a little bit from the foreign voters. I doubt that they would have any idea what a yellow ribbon stands for. This was very wel shor none the less. Good color and sharpness. However due to the unexiting objects in the shot I feel you might have done a bit better playing around with gaussian blur, or a pin hole lens. This would have enhanced the shot a bit disguising the mundane aspects, and perhaps enhancing the technical aspects of the shot. I ended up giving this a 4.

I'm not really a fan of what I usually (and probably unfairly) regard as \"gimmicky\" shots, but this one really does work.  Maybe it's the alarming lower torso amputation, but it's also the fact that the actual portrait shot is very good; at least a 6 on its own.  Add 1 for the idea + 1 for the execution = 8."}

I love the veins visible on the pit.  I would believe it if Weston had the idea for this shot (I don't recall seeing anything quite like this from him).  I just wish the lighting on the avocado skin wasn't so harsh.  With softer less obtrusive lighting I would have given this a 10."}
