Two you probably lost a little bit from the foreign voters. I doubt that they would have any idea what a yellow ribbon stands for. This was very wel shor none the less. Good color and sharpness. However due to the unexiting objects in the shot I feel you might have done a bit better playing around with gaussian blur, or a pin hole lens. This would have enhanced the shot a bit disguising the mundane aspects, and perhaps enhancing the technical aspects of the shot. I ended up giving this a 4.
