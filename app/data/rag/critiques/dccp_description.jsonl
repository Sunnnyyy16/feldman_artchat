I'm thinking maybe you could have included more of her hand and all of the cherries.  Also, the cherry is \"just\" against her lip.  Maybe a more \"seductive\" (adding to the glam concept) way to incorporate the cherries (or maybe just one cherry would have been better) was to have the model pucker her lips against the cherry?

For me the card adds nothing to this shot and I wonder if you were just adding 'pastel' colours to the image. I'm sure you could have found a better composition for this shot as although you took the time to seperate the beans they look badly angled.

Basically, the image met the challenge and you accomplished what you intended for the image but there are issues with composition and quality.  The primary issue is the picture looks out of focus.  This is most likely due to your post processing steps.  I not sure if Microsoft Office Picture Manager has the ability to sharpen images but most images look blurry after resizing.  As for the composition, I'm not sure if shooting this in portrait would have helped any.  The issue is that the dogs looking in opposite directions, which confuses the focus point for this image (do your eyes follow their stare towards the left or towards the right).  I would suggest that next time you have someone hold a treat so that they both look in the same direction and also have them sit so they aren't stacked one on top of the other.", "content": "The image features two dogs looking in opposite directions, creating a sense of confusion in the focus point."}
