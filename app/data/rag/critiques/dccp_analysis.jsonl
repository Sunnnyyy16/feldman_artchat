For me the card adds nothing to this shot and I wonder if you were just adding 'pastel' colours to the image. I'm sure you could have found a better composition for this shot as although you took the time to seperate the beans they look badly angled. I took the liberty of downloading the image and played with rotations and crops (tight on just the beans and blade) and, imho you'd get a much better effect.", "content": "The image appears overworked, resulting in an artificial look where the subject seems cut out against the pure white background.

I do like the subject and the angle presented is interesting but it presented some challenges and some drawbacks. The trombone player remains in the shadows (which I understand was the challenge of the contest) such that more attention is focused on the trombone. The front of the trombone appears as a flat circle with no defining features - if just a little more light could have been shed just on that spot to show the curve of the metal inward to a darker opening where the music bursts forth from, it would have further defined the object as seperate from the head of the player. Not to mention if that spot was illuminated a little more it would give a better sense of depth. Also I would have liked to have seen more distiction in the fingers of the trombone player. They would still be in shadow for this is a shilouette but it would have been nice to see the fingers \"dancing\" upon this instrument as it is played such that it helps invoke the imagery of music played in the viewer's ears.", "content": "The use of color creates a warm atmosphere, while the positioning of the trombone player and the instrument presents challenges in visibility.

Then I go home and blend the layers in Photoshop CS5.  I use the long exposure as the base and layer the short exposure over it.  I then fade the short exposure shot a little until the light looks good, and use a very soft brush to erase the rest of the short exposure layer.

Thank you all for some wonderful comments. My daughter was my model and she was getting tired after the 3rd session and absolutely refused to do the 4th after I realized that my best shot cut the top of her head off. Even the grains were thrown all over the place, we managed to save some and cook a delicious meal with well cleaned wheat.", "content": "The artist's process involved multiple sessions with the model, highlighting the dynamic between the artist and the subject. The mention of technical difficulties, such as cutting off the model's head in the best shot, indicates a struggle with composition and framing.

{"image_id": "784646.jpg", "original_comment": "I like everything about it except perhaps the foreground shoulder - I suspect that may be contributing to a lackluster response, as it does tend to overpower the rest of the shot (minus the eye, which grabs immediately!)  Makeup and costume are good, model is very pretty.  Though you were probably aiming for the shadow, a wee bit of fill on the right would soften it just a touch.  (Yeah, I can say stuff like that - have NO idea how to actually shoot or accomplish stuff like that.)  Trying to find a way to keep the shoulder (because I do like it there) but \"tone it down\" a bit - maybe add a bit on the right, as in a wee bit more space?  Vignette the lower left a touch?  Not sure.  Also like how you brought out the eye on the darkish side.  (Sorry about the meandering, but I'm going with what I see as I see it, yes?)  Finally, for DPC it needs to be sharper, crisper - the overall impression is one of softness, but not enough to be intentional softness, if that makes sense.  Anyway, better than what you're getting for it.", "content": "The foreground shoulder appears to dominate the composition, potentially detracting from the overall impact of the piece.

{"image_id": "372398.jpg", "original_comment": "This is just me, but if you were going to use a dead center placement, I think you would have been better off using a square format.

Would have liked to see a very thin border but that doesn't really matter either.  The focus and DOF of this image are perfect.  The conversion to black and white extremely well done - tonal range excellent.  Like the fact that you left in the noise - way too many images in this challenge are neat-imaged to death.  This one is refreshing in its simplicity, it straight forward presentation of the person and his personality. 10 - good luck in the challenge.", "content": "The viewer critiques the title as misaligned with the artwork's essence, indicating a disconnect between form and content. They suggest that a thin border could provide a more refined framing. The technical aspects, such as focus, depth of field, and tonal range, are praised, highlighting the artist's skill in black and white photography.

It's like everything has the same importance, with nothing predominant as the actual subject.

Haze is pretty much something you have to deal with by either waiting for better conditions, or using it to add to the mood of the shot. UV Filters and polarizers only do so much. In this shot - again very panoramic. If you dont want haze, exclude especially that whites of the sky and get more FG detail and lines that could lead to your water and the cliffs there. This is also a very contrasty shot/time of day and it's tough to work with this light. Hard to harmonize this light with the landscape shot you chose here", "content": "The use of haze can either enhance or detract from the mood, depending on the photographer's approach to capturing the scene.

{"image_id": "560403.jpg", "original_comment": "For DPC scoring, though, you have to get rid of harsh reflections.  Try putting a tissue in front of the flash or lights.  Diffusers work best when they're close to the subject and the light is far enough behind them to light them up totally.  I just saw a picture where the guy put a piece of tracing paper across a hanger and bent the wire into a stand.", "content": "The commenter notes that positioning diffusers appropriately and using materials like tracing paper can significantly enhance the quality of light in photographs. This indicates an understanding of light manipulation techniques in photography."}

The lighting appears flat, failing to highlight the eyes effectively."}
{"image_id": "959429.jpg", "original_comment": "This is a fabulous image. Breathtaking. It oozes NG quality. They have always pushed the boundaries and taken photography to new levels, always seeking a new angle or vantage point. From the zig zag of the riverine forested river to the left, the hand of man roads, clouds for depth, and the lovely shadow and 3D accentuation of the crater. Top marks. I hope you aren't getting nailed by the \"It's not a Lion, baby seal, African Tribe\" crowd...Even if you got lucky on a flight from A-Z, it's bloody hard to shoot through a porthole without some form artefacts, aberration and distortion. This would be the only reason I see why SC made this challenge Advanced and not Basic Editing.

As for the composition, I'm not sure if shooting this in portrait would have helped any.  The issue is that the dogs looking in opposite directions, which confuses the focus point for this image (do your eyes follow their stare towards the left or towards the right).  I would suggest that next time you have someone hold a treat so that they both look in the same direction and also have them sit so they aren't stacked one on top of the other.", "content": "The image appears out of focus, likely due to post-processing issues, particularly during resizing. The composition may have been affected by the dogs' positioning."}

{"image_id": "765274.jpg", "original_comment": "Not sure on what to say about this one.

I use three lights. One on either side of the subject and one near me. the side lights I usually have one point somewhat up and one point somewhat down relative to the subject's body. The one near me is usually a bit higher than the person's head, but not always. Always higher if they are wearing glasses. If I am shooting with a white background, I point the side lights up and down as before but pointing more towards the background than the subject.", "content": "The use of three lights, with specific angles and positions for each, contributes to the overall evenness of the lighting, enhancing the subject's features and reducing harsh shadows."}

I really like low DOF images but I think that works best where you can see a point of real sharpness. I have seen soft images that I really like, but they tend to use depth a bit more effectively and have more interesting colours; I'm thinking of the sort of images   produces. Still, this is a nice picture though and for all my nit-picking, I have given a 7.", "content": "The viewer notes that while they enjoy low DOF images, effective use of depth and more vibrant colors can enhance the impact of soft images.
