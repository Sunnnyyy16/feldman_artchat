This usually makes the subject pop out of the picture in a beautiful way.  Unless they work really well or are a very important part of the picture, cluttered backgrounds can be a bit distracting.  Also try making your subject a bit off-centre in the frame, as it tends to add much interest.  Search for \"rule of thirds\" on Google to learn what makes a very pleasing composition.

For example, the lower portion of the frame shows a nice straight line that matches the frame, but the lines at the top of the building seem a bit distorted. This has the effect for me of skewing the entire composition in a distracting way. You have also elected to frame or crop the image in such a way that cuts out what looks to be an interesting structure at top, but your crop has left in a distracting element at extreme upper left. This is incongruous, to me, with the formal style of capturing the six windows in a very regular pattern.", "content": "The upper lines of the building appear distorted, which skews the overall composition. Additionally, the cropping excludes an intriguing structure at the top while including a distracting element in the upper left corner."}

{"image_id": "148660.jpg", "original_comment": "I agree with Imagineer....the composition here is great and the subject is captured well. However, the \"uber-burning\" of the sky detracts from the effectiveness of the image, causing a beautiful photo to become a cartoon parody of itself.", "content": "The use of color, particularly in the sky, is described as 'uber-burning,' which suggests an over-exaggeration that affects the overall visual impact."}

{"image_id": "595586.jpg", "original_comment": "Nice, sharp shot of the bike. What I've found with the sodium vapor lights is if I set my white balance to tungsten, it tones down the garish yellow color a bit, and it creates some really cool blues and purples in the sky.

Stock Photography means something different to almost anyone I talk to, but one thing most people agree on is that the image has to be diverse enough to sell to multiple markets.

I fully understand the separation that you are portraying in this shot. I was in the military for seveal years and can fully understand the pain and anguish that the military spouse feel when ther loved ones are away.I think your shot may have been hurt a little bit in score for two reasons one Like you stated in your PM just not real exiting. Two you probably lost a little bit from the foreign voters. I doubt that they would have any idea what a yellow ribbon stands for. This was very wel shor none the less. Good color and sharpness. However due to the unexiting objects in the shot I feel you might have done a bit better playing around with gaussian blur, or a pin hole lens. This would have enhanced the shot a bit disguising the mundane aspects, and perhaps enhancing the technical aspects of the shot. I ended up giving this a 4. Solely on the fact that it lacked excitement or interest. On the bright side however as I stated earlier however this was very well shot.", "content": "The shot is technically proficient, with good color and sharpness. However, it lacks excitement and may not resonate with viewers unfamiliar with the symbolism of the yellow ribbon."}
