This usually makes the subject pop out of the picture in a beautiful way.  Unless they work really well or are a very important part of the picture, cluttered backgrounds can be a bit distracting.  Also try making your subject a bit off-centre in the frame, as it tends to add much interest.  Search for \"rule of thirds\" on Google to learn what makes a very pleasing composition.

This has the effect for me of skewing the entire composition in a distracting way. You have also elected to frame or crop the image in such a way that cuts out what looks to be an interesting structure at top, but your crop has left in a distracting element at extreme upper left.

Stock Photography means something different to almost anyone I talk to, but one thing most people agree on is that the image has to be diverse enough to sell to multiple markets.

Two you probably lost a little bit from the foreign voters. I doubt that they would have any idea what a yellow ribbon stands for. This was very wel shor none the less. Good color and sharpness. However due to the unexiting objects in the shot I feel you might have done a bit better playing around with gaussian blur, or a pin hole lens. This would have enhanced the shot a bit disguising the mundane aspects, and perhaps enhancing the technical aspects of the shot. I ended up giving this a 4.
