I guess the thing that throws me off is how exactly are you trying to work the cherries into the \"glam\" image???  I see just the tips of her fingers and part of the left cherry is cut off; both of which is distracting from the glam concept.  I'm thinking maybe you could have included more of her hand and all of the cherries.  Also, the cherry is \"just\" against her lip.  Maybe a more \"seductive\" (adding to the glam concept) way to incorporate the cherries (or maybe just one cherry would have been better) was to have the model pucker her lips against the cherry?  The photo just seems to be missing something...

What I do like about that issue, however, is that much like in your photo \"my country\", the over saturation adds a painting sort of feel to the image. So IMO it depends on what your aim is. I also have a feeling that this shot would make an amazing square crop, if some of the top were chopped off. You sure do seem to live in a beautiful country.

The placement of the pins appears to be haphazard, and some have even been partially cropped by the edge of the frame or are partially disappearing into the large black void in the background.  There was probably a better, more creative approach to this subject.  Maybe even arranging the pins in the form of a question mark and composing so that the pin cushion fills the frame.

For me the card adds nothing to this shot and I wonder if you were just adding 'pastel' colours to the image. I'm sure you could have found a better composition for this shot as although you took the time to seperate the beans they look badly angled.

The front of the trombone appears as a flat circle with no defining features - if just a little more light could have been shed just on that spot to show the curve of the metal inward to a darker opening where the music bursts forth from, it would have further defined the object as seperate from the head of the player. Not to mention if that spot was illuminated a little more it would give a better sense of depth. Also I would have liked to have seen more distiction in the fingers of the trombone player. They would still be in shadow for this is a shilouette but it would have been nice to see the fingers \"dancing\" upon this instrument as it is played such that it helps invoke the imagery of music played in the viewer's ears.", "content": "While the warm tones and interesting angle contribute to the overall appeal, the execution falls short in defining key elements, which detracts from the artwork's potential to convey the vibrancy of music."}

The way she's set up is also very staged, I now she's supposed to be dead but she just looks like she's staring off into space.  Maybe if the eyes were rolled back a little more.

The amount of texture in the glass you were able to maintain is very, very good. I have a bunch of these and toyed with the idea...glad i didn't - this surpasses anything I could have done.  The lighting is excellent - really lets the shape and texture stand for itself.  Also lets the color be itself and not forced at all.  Very well done - underappreciated in the voting I think.

Then I go home and blend the layers in Photoshop CS5.  I use the long exposure as the base and layer the short exposure over it.  I then fade the short exposure shot a little until the light looks good, and use a very soft brush to erase the rest of the short exposure layer.

Haze is pretty much something you have to deal with by either waiting for better conditions, or using it to add to the mood of the shot. UV Filters and polarizers only do so much. In this shot - again very panoramic. If you dont want haze, exclude especially that whites of the sky and get more FG detail and lines that could lead to your water and the cliffs there. This is also a very contrasty shot/time of day and it's tough to work with this light.

{"image_id": "339413.jpg", "original_comment": "The biggest problem in my opinion is lack of focus. It makes it hard to appreciate the photo when I'm not even sure what the subject is - the background could be trees but I'm not certain. The blue object could be a ribbon but again its not clear. Its a very rare photo that works well for me when everything is blurry.", "content": "While the photograph may resonate with some viewers who appreciate its blurriness, the overall lack of clarity detracts from its effectiveness as a visual statement."}

{"image_id": "1116848.jpg", "original_comment": "You're wrong on both counts. Borders generally fall outside of the normal editing rules (you can't otherwise make selections in Basic, for example) as long as the frame is distinct and goes around the outside, and no text, clip art or other photographs were added.

{"image_id": "783971.jpg", "original_comment": "Interesting that three of the entries were either taken at the same event or of the same subject.  A lot of horses on a small frame chassis does fit the bill of \"not quite right\". From an image standpoint, it might have helped to use a longer view or conversely a short view to increase the impact of the image in terms of \"power\", but it works as it is.", "content": "While the images are effective as they stand, exploring different perspectives could enhance their visual impact and emotional power."}

{"image_id": "549774.jpg", "original_comment": "Your composition is good.  I especially like how the color really fades out to white on the upper left.

I think I need to just go with my first impression, which was: \"What am I supposed to be looking at?\"  There is not really a point of focus in this image. The dock poles are in focus, but they are sort of divided up, so my eyes go in two directions. Then there is a seagull that is center stage, but not really occupying enough of the picture in comparison to the poles to keep the eye on that spot. I think the idea was there, but maybe a slightly better composition would have upped the wow factor.", "content": "While the concept shows potential, a more cohesive composition could enhance the overall impact of the piece."}

Most of the time, the results don't transcend the cliche. Perhaps your success with your audience comes from transcending the nude cliche? My favorite in this photo essay is Trauma. I like her attitude, the bandage worn like an accessory, the nudity is part of her attitude (not a lack of clothing). She's a dancer.

I hope you aren't getting nailed by the \"It's not a Lion, baby seal, African Tribe\" crowd...Even if you got lucky on a flight from A-Z, it's bloody hard to shoot through a porthole without some form artefacts, aberration and distortion.

Basically, the image met the challenge and you accomplished what you intended for the image but there are issues with composition and quality.  The primary issue is the picture looks out of focus.  This is most likely due to your post processing steps.  I not sure if Microsoft Office Picture Manager has the ability to sharpen images but most images look blurry after resizing.  As for the composition, I'm not sure if shooting this in portrait would have helped any.  The issue is that the dogs looking in opposite directions, which confuses the focus point for this image (do your eyes follow their stare towards the left or towards the right).
