Perhaps the only thing that mars it is the brightness of the OOF background, I think some dodging to subdue it would be of great benefit overall. The image works because it conveys a peaceful feeling of the patient wait for the catch savouring your surroundings with a nice cuppa.", "content": "Overall, the piece is compelling, but reducing the brightness of the background through dodging techniques would enhance its impact."}

{"image_id": "190213.jpg", "original_comment": "The disturbing part of the image is the exceptionally noisy looking bacground items surrounding the noiseless smoke. It is so grainy that it actually is distracting to the image. The wall on the left side of the image with the running wires adds little to the composition and you might consider cropping it out of th framing just right of the rightmost wire. The candle seems out of place because it does not seem it could privide the illuminating light for the green smoke and draws the viewer's eye away from the singer. There is some slight haloing around the singer but it is not terribly bad.", "content": "While the piece has intriguing elements, the distracting background and the misplacement of the candle undermine the composition's effectiveness. Consideration for cropping and refining the light sources could enhance viewer engagement."}

Anyways, I like the corner perspective that show the people going about their business.  Looks like a night shot, if so, it's incredibly clean.  I like the red color of the bar.  I like the \"busy-ness\" of the image; personally, it draws me into the picture like perhaps I'm part of it.  The signs, plants, people give it lots of visual interest.  I don't think a viewer can be \"bored\" with this picture.

{"image_id": "790696.jpg", "original_comment": "I would say the exposure is correct, the green looks green and the blue looks blue '' I said honestly :) ''. Is it interesting?

{"image_id": "340253.jpg", "original_comment": "I think that in order for this photo to be taken to the next level, you'd have to spend a good bit of time thinking about composition.  Really think it through.  Where do you want your viewer's eye to start, where should the focal point be?  Think along the lines of the rule of thirds.  Draw the viewer's eye into the scene, and give it something (at a convenient location in the image) to rest on.  And always allow a bit of movement -- maybe a couple more string things placed a bit in the background completely out of the focal plane just adding a little bit...or think one single string...", "content": "Improving the composition by incorporating these suggestions could elevate the photograph, making it more compelling and inviting for the audience."}

I love the processing in this one. You've taken what would otherwise be a mundane architectural shot and softened the hard lines with that ethereal glow. The contrast is amazing and I especially like the row of empty chairs.

{"image_id": "1145122.jpg", "original_comment": "A great composition and a beautiful photograph altogether. The weaving between new and old is marvelous. The boy/man on the left could come out from one of Velasquez paintings, the old trees and shutters from a French landscape while the lighting is the witness of modern times with the roar of bikes (ah, les motards!)", "content": "Overall, the photograph is a successful and beautiful composition that effectively conveys its themes, making it a noteworthy piece of art."}

It looks to me as though extra sharpening may have been applied aroung the eyes, and for me it's just a little too much, but maybe that's just excellent focusing with good glass and my imagination : )", "content": "While the technical aspects of lighting and focus are commendable, the unnatural pose detracts from the overall authenticity of the moment being captured."}
{"image_id": "569842.jpg", "original_comment": "Hang on, that's not Yorkshire!  Despite the inaccuracy of your title, I do like this - a wonderful sky.

{"image_id": "192258.jpg", "original_comment": "This is a good start to what I consider \"product photography\". Shiny metal is quite difficult to photograph in studio. Especially spoons. Let me try to critique this from a purely technical studio approach. The composition to me looks not very well thought out. The front edge ofthe spoon is barely visible. I would like to see the entire rim be lit. The business end of the spoon would be better if it were all in focus. I don't mind the handle fading out at all. The tone is good throughout, but the upper right edge is a bit distracting. It looks as though it is the edge of your backdrop.", "content": "Overall, while the photograph shows promise, it requires improved composition and technical execution to fully realize its potential in product photography."}

{"image_id": "954090.jpg", "original_comment": "I enjoyed the minimalism and composure but not the grainy, noisy BG. Why didn't you post your camera settings?

{"image_id": "396051.jpg", "original_comment": "Now back to the photo. I'd consider perhaps a closer view capturing the road in more detail in order to heighten the path of lines. If you were to crop the rightside so as to include the pillar on the right as opposed to center. And cropped out the tree on the left which just becomes distracting as it is half cut.
