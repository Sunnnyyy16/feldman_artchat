This is one of those few cases where I would suggest a tighter crop (getting rid of as much of the bg clutter as you can) and converting the image to b/w, so the viewer focuses more on the form of the wheel which is what is important here.

Even if you just took one element of this photo and focused on the technicals, I think this would portray personality better. Just a sandal with great lighting on a beach or a sidewalk, just travel books, just the camera... there are so many elements with potential here and by trying to cram them all in to one shot I think the connection between your personality and the viewer is lost.", "content": "The viewer feels that the images do not effectively convey the subject's personality and suggest that focusing on individual elements could enhance the narrative."}

You just have to choose 1 that works best.  In This case the choice I would make is the corner where the blue and orange facades meet because of its strengthe.  The building as it is, is heavily weighted to the left of the image so it appears to be listing.  Just by rotating the image a tiny bit, it will regain its balance.

You might want to think about shooting at a larger aperture size next time, so that more of the background is in bokeh (more is blurry).  This usually makes the subject pop out of the picture in a beautiful way.  Unless they work really well or are a very important part of the picture, cluttered backgrounds can be a bit distracting.  Also try making your subject a bit off-centre in the frame, as it tends to add much interest.  Search for \"rule of thirds\" on Google to learn what makes a very pleasing composition.

Excellent focus, and shallow DOF at this range make this a very pleasing image.  I reach for my Micro Nikkor 55 manual focus when things seem to be getting dull, and the boredom is always gone in just a few minutes.

{"image_id": "339083.jpg", "original_comment": "Although you've taken a picture of a very interesting building, and the composition in general is interesting, there are a few techincial difficulties with your photograph that detract from the overall impact. For example, the lower portion of the frame shows a nice straight line that matches the frame, but the lines at the top of the building seem a bit distorted. This has the effect for me of skewing the entire composition in a distracting way. You have also elected to frame or crop the image in such a way that cuts out what looks to be an interesting structure at top, but your crop has left in a distracting element at extreme upper left. This is incongruous, to me, with the formal style of capturing the six windows in a very regular pattern.", "content": "The distortions and cropping choices create a sense of incongruity, contrasting with the otherwise formal arrangement of the six windows."}

I think though, for the title to fit perfectly, the eyes would be looking directly at the viewer.

Even now, knowing they are there, my eyes are drawn back to the boy.", "content": "The photograph invites viewers to connect with the boy's emotional state, suggesting themes of resilience and innocence.

{"image_id": "760410.jpg", "original_comment": "I like your idea, but I think the background isn't 'still' enough: there's too much going on in terms of trees, lampposts and vans. You could maybe have made the silence a little more poignant by having a lone figure (in baseball/football outfit) leaving the field. Maybe a little lower vantage point. Of course, if it hadn't been basic editing, you could've worked with the colors to make it a feel more deserted, too.", "content": "The artist's intention may be to convey a moment of solitude, but the busy background undermines this message. A lower vantage point could provide a more intimate perspective."}
{"image_id": "349755.jpg", "original_comment": "Great POV! ... the background helps to tell the story, but it just doesn't scream \"bokeh\" to me.

{"image_id": "749495.jpg", "original_comment": "My initial impression of your image was that it was excellent for the challenge because it had the added benefit of being something you wouldn't normally see without actually being in Asia.  I like how you have his vibrant colors juxtaposed against the rather dreariness of the buildings and hillside behind him.  Though I'm not familiar with Amber Ft Keeper...I assumed it was in India.  Your image makes me think of how even though India struggles with poverty, it's people over come and are quite happy with their daily lives, lives filled with celebration and costume.", "content": "The image evokes a sense of resilience and joy within the context of poverty, suggesting that despite challenging circumstances, the spirit of the people remains celebratory and vibrant."}

{"image_id": "148660.jpg", "original_comment": "I agree with Imagineer....the composition here is great and the subject is captured well. However, the \"uber-burning\" of the sky detracts from the effectiveness of the image, causing a beautiful photo to become a cartoon parody of itself.", "content": "The intense treatment of the sky creates a contrast that shifts the photo's tone from beautiful to somewhat comical, suggesting a loss of seriousness."}

{"image_id": "595586.jpg", "original_comment": "Nice, sharp shot of the bike. What I've found with the sodium vapor lights is if I set my white balance to tungsten, it tones down the garish yellow color a bit, and it creates some really cool blues and purples in the sky.

{"image_id": "157884.jpg", "original_comment": "This is the tricky part.  Stock Photography means something different to almost anyone I talk to, but one thing most people agree on is that the image has to be diverse enough to sell to multiple markets.  This shot almost has too much of a \"personal\" feel to it, but it's also something akin to shots I've seen in some major magazine markets like \"Woman's World\", \"Parents\", \"Chatelaine\" and the like.  I don't feel it's a  connection, but I don't feel it's particularily weak either.", "content": "The image's unique perspective could resonate with niche audiences, but it may struggle to attract a wider market due to its personal nature."}

I fully understand the separation that you are portraying in this shot. I was in the military for seveal years and can fully understand the pain and anguish that the military spouse feel when ther loved ones are away.I think your shot may have been hurt a little bit in score for two reasons one Like you stated in your PM just not real exiting. Two you probably lost a little bit from the foreign voters. I doubt that they would have any idea what a yellow ribbon stands for. This was very wel shor none the less. Good color and sharpness. However due to the unexiting objects in the shot I feel you might have done a bit better playing around with gaussian blur, or a pin hole lens. This would have enhanced the shot a bit disguising the mundane aspects, and perhaps enhancing the technical aspects of the shot. I ended up giving this a 4. Solely on the fact that it lacked excitement or interest. On the bright side however as I stated earlier however this was very well shot.", "content": "The photograph conveys the emotional pain of military spouses during deployments, yet its impact is diminished by the choice of subject matter and composition."}

{"image_id": "785319.jpg", "original_comment": "A very good action shot that falls just short of being a technical success.

A good solid entry into the challenge.", "content": "The artist successfully navigates the challenge in a unique manner."}
{"image_id": "158876.jpg", "original_comment": "Neat idea and tough to shoot.  Every will have different opinion...but I would rather see the stone in focus as well, or alone.

{"image_id": "781610.jpg", "original_comment": "A very creative look at colored pencils - the image meets the subject matter and with a certain cheeky attitude. A terrific demonstration of the creative process in meeting the challenge. Should be a sure bet to win a ribbon or place high as a top twenty image.  A couple of minor detail problems not worth mentioning because they don't appear until you really get a critical eye and examine the image closely.  Well done.", "content": "This piece reflects an innovative approach to a common subject, suggesting that creativity can transform ordinary objects into engaging art."}
{"image_id": "167528.jpg", "original_comment": "Drive by shooting? I say this due to the lack of sharp focus and over powering frame you've used.

I'm not really a fan of what I usually (and probably unfairly) regard as \"gimmicky\" shots, but this one really does work.

{"image_id": "381147.jpg", "original_comment": "voted this with a 4.  i think the \"1920's style\" concept would have been more effective if it was monochrome, or sepia or somesuch. it also feels a messy photograph in terms of set up, and lessens the impact as a result.  maybe having fewer pieces of kit in the frame (such as just the two canon SLRs?) might make it more balanced.  it also feels tilted, and the sigma flash looks odd pointing upwards.   there just feels to be too much here.", "content": "The artist's intention to evoke a 1920s aesthetic is undermined by the chaotic arrangement and lack of cohesion. A monochrome or sepia palette might have enhanced the nostalgic feel, while a more selective focus on fewer items could provide a stronger visual impact."}

{"image_id": "147006.jpg", "original_comment": "I think this is a great little bridge, but I really think it would be a more effective photo if some part of it were the focus - that is, if the rocks and trees were a little blurred compared to the bridge.

Now that I think about, it could just be that it's small (you're allowed 640 px at the longest end and you have used only 432).", "content": "The viewer suggests that focusing on the bridge by blurring the surrounding elements or changing the angle could enhance the image's effectiveness."}
{"image_id": "943155.jpg", "original_comment": "Ah, wonderful selection!  I love the veins visible on the pit.  I would believe it if Weston had the idea for this shot (I don't recall seeing anything quite like this from him).  I just wish the lighting on the avocado skin wasn't so harsh.

Certainly I do think that the shallow DOF background works well for the image and I also like the little bit of detail and reflection on the container but - the shapes and colours of the background don't thrill me. There's also something weird about the luminous nature of the dandelion head - something about the lighting perhaps that looks odd to me. I voted this a 6.", "content": "The luminous quality of the dandelion head suggests an intention to highlight its fragility and beauty, yet the lighting may detract from its overall effectiveness."}

{"image_id": "747901.jpg", "original_comment": "My first thought is that I love the sharpness of the bud compared to the soft background. This is what really makes this photograph. The greens are really nice and the water droplets are a nice addition. After reading the comments below, I agree that this would look really good as a square crop. I think it would help hold my attention on the bud, instead of slipping off the top or bottom of the photograph. If it were my photograph, I would brighten it up a bit overall, but this might be a personal taste. Great shot overall, and not difficult to see why you finished in the top 30.

{"image_id": "966704.jpg", "original_comment": "Great photo. Lots of stripes and a great composition. I think it just needs a little more light.
