I'm thinking maybe you could have included more of her hand and all of the cherries.  Also, the cherry is \"just\" against her lip.  Maybe a more \"seductive\" (adding to the glam concept) way to incorporate the cherries (or maybe just one cherry would have been better) was to have the model pucker her lips against the cherry?

I'm sure you could have found a better composition for this shot as although you took the time to seperate the beans they look badly angled. I took the liberty of downloading the image and played with rotations and crops (tight on just the beans and blade) and, imho you'd get a much better effect.", "content": "The intent may have been to create a clean and minimalist aesthetic, but the execution detracts from the overall impact, suggesting a lack of cohesion between the elements."}

{"image_id": "177466.jpg", "original_comment": "I like how the hues here play to the \"warm\" tones - browns and golds. I do like the subject and the angle presented is interesting but it presented some challenges and some drawbacks. The trombone player remains in the shadows (which I understand was the challenge of the contest) such that more attention is focused on the trombone. The front of the trombone appears as a flat circle with no defining features - if just a little more light could have been shed just on that spot to show the curve of the metal inward to a darker opening where the music bursts forth from, it would have further defined the object as seperate from the head of the player. Not to mention if that spot was illuminated a little more it would give a better sense of depth. Also I would have liked to have seen more distiction in the fingers of the trombone player. They would still be in shadow for this is a shilouette but it would have been nice to see the fingers \"dancing\" upon this instrument as it is played such that it helps invoke the imagery of music played in the viewer's ears.", "content": "The shadowy representation of the trombone player emphasizes the instrument itself, suggesting a narrative of music emerging from the darkness.

The way she's set up is also very staged, I now she's supposed to be dead but she just looks like she's staring off into space.  Maybe if the eyes were rolled back a little more.  And I would also like to have seen both feet completely in the shot.  A 3, sorry :(", "content": "The work attempts to convey a sense of horror or tragedy but falls short due to its artificiality.

The amount of texture in the glass you were able to maintain is very, very good. I have a bunch of these and toyed with the idea...glad i didn't - this surpasses anything I could have done.  The lighting is excellent - really lets the shape and texture stand for itself.  Also lets the color be itself and not forced at all.  Very well done - underappreciated in the voting I think.

From there it gets softer especially as you rise up the walls.", "content": "The soft focus may be a deliberate choice to evoke a sense of dreaminess or to draw attention to specific elements, such as the plant near the door.

Then I go home and blend the layers in Photoshop CS5.  I use the long exposure as the base and layer the short exposure over it.  I then fade the short exposure shot a little until the light looks good, and use a very soft brush to erase the rest of the short exposure layer.

Thank you all for some wonderful comments. My daughter was my model and she was getting tired after the 3rd session and absolutely refused to do the 4th after I realized that my best shot cut the top of her head off. Even the grains were thrown all over the place, we managed to save some and cook a delicious meal with well cleaned wheat.", "content": "The piece may reflect the artist's emotional journey and the challenges of balancing artistic ambition with the realities of working with a young model.

{"image_id": "784646.jpg", "original_comment": "I like everything about it except perhaps the foreground shoulder - I suspect that may be contributing to a lackluster response, as it does tend to overpower the rest of the shot (minus the eye, which grabs immediately!)  Makeup and costume are good, model is very pretty.  Though you were probably aiming for the shadow, a wee bit of fill on the right would soften it just a touch.  (Yeah, I can say stuff like that - have NO idea how to actually shoot or accomplish stuff like that.)  Trying to find a way to keep the shoulder (because I do like it there) but \"tone it down\" a bit - maybe add a bit on the right, as in a wee bit more space?  Vignette the lower left a touch?  Not sure.  Also like how you brought out the eye on the darkish side.  (Sorry about the meandering, but I'm going with what I see as I see it, yes?)  Finally, for DPC it needs to be sharper, crisper - the overall impression is one of softness, but not enough to be intentional softness, if that makes sense.  Anyway, better than what you're getting for it.", "content": "The artist may have intended to create a strong focal point with the shoulder, but its overpowering presence could lead to a less dynamic response from viewers.

{"image_id": "174176.jpg", "original_comment": "Actually, it is not so much the blurrinesss of the leaves as it is that without them, the eye does not stray to the right.  Even if they had been in focus they would have drawn attention away from the subject.", "content": "The leaves, whether in focus or not, function to contain the viewer's gaze, preventing distraction from the primary focus of the piece."}

{"image_id": "350068.jpg", "original_comment": "Definitely meets the challenge and exhibits proper bokeh.  The subject matter leaves me wanting (not because it's a flower - I have nothing against flowers - it just lacks a \"wow\" factor for me).

{"image_id": "996813.jpg", "original_comment": "Interesting subject, cool old school processing... but it looks old school in composition too.  I wish there was a little more land on the left, just to add some interest.  Or maybe more trees?  Not sure, just a bit off to me.  Still a nice image.", "content": "The artist's choice of composition may evoke nostalgia, yet it risks feeling static or incomplete without further dynamic elements."}
{"image_id": "372398.jpg", "original_comment": "This is just me, but if you were going to use a dead center placement, I think you would have been better off using a square format.

The background and waldo are under exposed and muddy.", "content": "The chaotic arrangement of elements may suggest a fleeting moment captured in time, reflecting the unpredictability of nature. However, the technical shortcomings detract from the intended impact."}
{"image_id": "379243.jpg", "original_comment": "The New guys in the background look great. The blur is nice and the lighting on them is great. The peas up front seem to be a bit dark or contrasty to me. A bit lighter and maybe a tad more color sat could have been nice. I also think that more space onthe bottom to balance out the empty space on top could have been nice as well. The crop on the bottom feels a bit too tight.", "content": "The artist may be attempting to create a focal point with the background figures, but the execution results in an imbalance that detracts from the overall harmony of the piece. The dark peas could symbolize a contrast to the more vibrant background, but the lack of color saturation undermines this intention."}

{"image_id": "339421.jpg", "original_comment": "Maybe the shadow on the left could have been slightly smaller somehow?  Maby taken at a different time of the day, but the shadow does not distract from the overall shot in my opinion.", "content": "The shadow could symbolize the interplay of light and time, influencing the mood of the piece."}
{"image_id": "355081.jpg", "original_comment": "I wish that the focus was more exactly on the stamen.

Would have liked to see a very thin border but that doesn't really matter either.  The focus and DOF of this image are perfect.  The conversion to black and white extremely well done - tonal range excellent.  Like the fact that you left in the noise - way too many images in this challenge are neat-imaged to death.  This one is refreshing in its simplicity, it straight forward presentation of the person and his personality. 10 - good luck in the challenge.", "content": "The viewer interprets the artwork as a genuine representation of the subject, appreciating its straightforwardness and simplicity.

{"image_id": "785059.jpg", "original_comment": "Interesting idea.  Very nicely shot but it's not coming together for me.  It's like everything has the same importance, with nothing predominant as the actual subject.  The sky is very interesting and bold, the corn is very sharp and textured and colorful, the beakers have great clarity and shine.  There's too much to look at and nothing to decisively focus on.", "content": "The abundance of interesting details may overwhelm the viewer, creating a sense of confusion rather than clarity."}

Haze is pretty much something you have to deal with by either waiting for better conditions, or using it to add to the mood of the shot. UV Filters and polarizers only do so much. In this shot - again very panoramic. If you dont want haze, exclude especially that whites of the sky and get more FG detail and lines that could lead to your water and the cliffs there. This is also a very contrasty shot/time of day and it's tough to work with this light. Hard to harmonize this light with the landscape shot you chose here", "content": "The artist's choice to work with hazy conditions suggests an exploration of atmospheric effects, but it also presents challenges in achieving clarity and harmony within the landscape."}

One could say it's dreary, but I'd prefer to see it as nature all embracing.  It's touching, mysterious and curiously balanced in composition and tone.  If JJ found himself in this setting, this would be a shot he'd take.

I think I need to just go with my first impression, which was: \"What am I supposed to be looking at?\"  There is not really a point of focus in this image. The dock poles are in focus, but they are sort of divided up, so my eyes go in two directions. Then there is a seagull that is center stage, but not really occupying enough of the picture in comparison to the poles to keep the eye on that spot. I think the idea was there, but maybe a slightly better composition would have upped the wow factor.", "content": "The artist may have intended to evoke a sense of disorientation or fragmentation, but this intention is undermined by the unclear focal point."}

{"image_id": "782570.jpg", "original_comment": "IMO - you should have filled the whole frame with the hearts. Too much white space towards the bottom of the pic.", "content": "The artist may be attempting to convey themes of love and emptiness, with the hearts representing affection and the white space suggesting a lack of fulfillment or presence."}

{"image_id": "346252.jpg", "original_comment": "This is one shot that loses a lot by having to scroll through it, rather than seeing it as a whole (I don't take off points for that - it's just frustrating). That's always a tradeoff in vertical shots - a good size versus the inability of many monitors to take in the whole shot at once.", "content": "The scrolling requirement suggests a tension between the artwork's intended impact and the constraints of digital viewing technology."}
{"image_id": "184073.jpg", "original_comment": "Woah, amazing shot man this rocks (literally) haha....not funny. but okay absolutely amazing. Looks so beautiful ;)", "content": "The image evokes a sense of awe and admiration, reflecting the artist's ability to capture the essence of the scene."}

{"image_id": "1111876.jpg", "original_comment": "Nudes. Different experience, getting the shot vs viewing the result. Like everything else with photography it's all about the light. Most of the time, the results don't transcend the cliche. Perhaps your success with your audience comes from transcending the nude cliche? My favorite in this photo essay is Trauma. I like her attitude, the bandage worn like an accessory, the nudity is part of her attitude (not a lack of clothing). She's a dancer. You caught her as she went by, dancing.", "content": "The subject in 'Trauma' is a dancer whose attitude is emphasized by the bandage she wears, suggesting strength and resilience rather than vulnerability. The nudity is framed as an expression of her identity rather than a mere absence of clothing."}

{"image_id": "964996.jpg", "original_comment": "As for processing, it's an aged look preset on the camera application.

{"image_id": "377381.jpg", "original_comment": "Absolutely beautiful.  I love the richness of the black, the white is not too bright as to overwhelm, instead it offsets the deep black perfectly.  The composition is great, excellent focus, just a great image all around.  I kind of wish there was some sort of more substantial border just to make it have that finished/framed look, but that's just gravy.  Nicely captured.  I am upping from an 8 to a 9 and adding a favorite.", "content": "The use of black and white suggests a dynamic tension, evoking emotions of depth and clarity, while the request for a substantial border indicates a desire for a more complete presentation."}

I am not sure if it was the best for this challenge but I love the contrast between the woman in the wheelchair and the young girl walking and the pictures in the poster. Great shot", "content": "This contrast may symbolize the diverse experiences of individuals and the societal perceptions of ability and youth."}
{"image_id": "560403.jpg", "original_comment": "For DPC scoring, though, you have to get rid of harsh reflections.  Try putting a tissue in front of the flash or lights.  Diffusers work best when they're close to the subject and the light is far enough behind them to light them up totally.  I just saw a picture where the guy put a piece of tracing paper across a hanger and bent the wire into a stand.", "content": "The advice reflects a deeper awareness of how light interacts with subjects in photography, suggesting that careful consideration of lighting can improve the overall aesthetic and technical quality of an image."}

{"image_id": "765091.jpg", "original_comment": "The \"Image\" part of the submission would not be any larger, and you would not be able to see any more detail if the border wasn't there, as it is cropped @640px as per basic editing rules.  Without the frame, the image just looks too wide for me, which is why I put it in there to stabilize the shot and have some black to contrast against, instead of the grey of the DPC viewing pages.  Of course its just a personal thing, I just happen to like how it looks.", "content": "The artist's choice to include a border reflects a personal aesthetic preference, aiming to create visual balance and clarity within the composition."}
{"image_id": "379535.jpg", "original_comment": "I like the textures.  Did you try the shot with the glass closer to the camera?", "content": "The textures may symbolize complexity and richness in the subject matter, inviting viewers to explore the nuances of the piece."}
{"image_id": "1101391.jpg", "original_comment": "Agree! Very interesting. Having the softbox in the shot is compelling. A real photographer self portrait.

{"image_id": "168575.jpg", "original_comment": "Brilliant idea! the Brooch is well lit, nice & sparkely. But the flower isnt as nice, quite dark on the right and a bit blown out on the left. A pretty shot none the less", "content": "The contrast between the brooch and the flower may symbolize the duality of beauty and imperfection, inviting viewers to appreciate both the brilliance and flaws in the composition."}
{"image_id": "564402.jpg", "original_comment": "wow, that took me a few seconds to figure this out. I think if you had greater DOF, especially on the head, it might lessen the confusion and I'd be able to focus more on the great subject matter and lighting.

{"image_id": "158045.jpg", "original_comment": "Loved the way u stacked the glasses and used the background to give a \"mirror\" effect!", "content": "The stacking of glasses may symbolize layers of perception or complexity, and the mirror effect could represent self-reflection or duality."}
{"image_id": "344508.jpg", "original_comment": "Wish the bottom 2 weren't in the shot but otherwise a great catch!  9", "content": "The viewer feels that the distracting elements could have been omitted to enhance the visual experience and clarity of the main subject."}
{"image_id": "768652.jpg", "original_comment": "Delightful little model, very nicely captured.  The very busy background is definitely problematic, though.", "content": "The busy background may distract from the model, potentially diminishing the viewer's focus on the primary subject."}

{"image_id": "548760.jpg", "original_comment": "I think the layers of different background colors with distinct borders detracts significantly from this photo.

{"image_id": "182327.jpg", "original_comment": "Sorry, not a fan of this one!! The background is not contrasting enough for this to make a decent image and the lighting could have been better-try and make the eyes shine more.", "content": "The artist may have intended to create a subtle atmosphere, but the execution results in a less engaging image. The lack of contrast and poor lighting choices detract from the overall emotional resonance."}
{"image_id": "959429.jpg", "original_comment": "This is a fabulous image. Breathtaking. It oozes NG quality. They have always pushed the boundaries and taken photography to new levels, always seeking a new angle or vantage point. From the zig zag of the riverine forested river to the left, the hand of man roads, clouds for depth, and the lovely shadow and 3D accentuation of the crater. Top marks. I hope you aren't getting nailed by the \"It's not a Lion, baby seal, African Tribe\" crowd...Even if you got lucky on a flight from A-Z, it's bloody hard to shoot through a porthole without some form artefacts, aberration and distortion. This would be the only reason I see why SC made this challenge Advanced and not Basic Editing. To allow the photographer some leeway in PP to get his shot NG-Like.", "content": "This work reflects the photographer's commitment to pushing the boundaries of traditional photography, emphasizing both natural and human elements in the landscape.

But so romantic all the same.", "content": "The romantic quality of the image evokes feelings of nostalgia and intimacy, inviting viewers to engage with the emotional depth of the scene."}
{"image_id": "971065.jpg", "original_comment": "Nice concept and idea, however the flash coming from a different direction than the sun (in the arch and the side of the column) is very distracting to me. I do like that the subject is lit so as to not be silhouetted by the sunlight, but a more subtle touch of flash would've brought this shot to the next level.", "content": "The lighting choices suggest an intention to highlight the subject without creating a silhouette, yet the execution leads to a disjointed visual experience."}

{"image_id": "168963.jpg", "original_comment": "A nice tribute to \"cowspace\" that was in negative space a while ago and one of the favorites on the site.

{"image_id": "566359.jpg", "original_comment": "I think a flash may have helped, but probably only if you stopped it down a little. Full flash may have overpowered the girl closest. As it was I think the lights and the windows made this shot difficult. Can probably be made even better with some PP, but I'm not the person to show you how.", "content": "The lighting dynamics suggest a struggle to balance the subject's visibility against the backdrop, indicating a need for careful consideration of flash settings."}

{"image_id": "368953.jpg", "original_comment": "I gave this image a 5.  Basically, the image met the challenge and you accomplished what you intended for the image but there are issues with composition and quality.  The primary issue is the picture looks out of focus.  This is most likely due to your post processing steps.  I not sure if Microsoft Office Picture Manager has the ability to sharpen images but most images look blurry after resizing.  As for the composition, I'm not sure if shooting this in portrait would have helped any.  The issue is that the dogs looking in opposite directions, which confuses the focus point for this image (do your eyes follow their stare towards the left or towards the right).  I would suggest that next time you have someone hold a treat so that they both look in the same direction and also have them sit so they aren't stacked one on top of the other.", "content": "The conflicting gazes of the dogs detract from the overall impact of the image, making it difficult for the viewer to determine where to focus."}

{"image_id": "184769.jpg", "original_comment": "Congratulations on this shot - it is one of the few times I've seen a picture of a toy that worked.  Nice detail in the sand.  The color yellow looks a bit flat, but the composition is great.  Overall, this is a very good shot.", "content": "The image captures a playful moment, evoking nostalgia and childhood memories, yet the flatness of the yellow suggests a missed opportunity for a more dynamic visual impact."}

{"image_id": "187889.jpg", "original_comment": "another center positioned photo. Would this have been used with the rule of thirds, I think it would have been better. The cables on the wall are distracting, and I think if you zoomed in on the skull itself, it would have a much stronger impact. You have good exposure here, looks as if a wide angle was used here with a large aperture, the focus seems to drop off.", "content": "The central placement and distracting background elements may dilute the intended impact of the skull, suggesting a need for a more dynamic composition that emphasizes the subject."}

{"image_id": "765274.jpg", "original_comment": "Not sure on what to say about this one.  It certainly fits the challenge criteria but, the out of focus to it and the gain as well as the suject matter somehow falls a bit short.  Was this taken through a car window by any chance?", "content": "The out-of-focus quality could symbolize a transient moment or a fleeting experience, but it risks alienating the audience due to its vagueness. The context of being taken from a moving car adds a layer of distance and detachment."}

{"image_id": "375273.jpg", "original_comment": "Good guess. I can see from the catch lights in her eyes that you have two lights relatively evenly spaced apart casting very even lighting. I use three lights. One on either side of the subject and one near me. the side lights I usually have one point somewhat up and one point somewhat down relative to the subject's body. The one near me is usually a bit higher than the person's head, but not always. Always higher if they are wearing glasses. If I am shooting with a white background, I point the side lights up and down as before but pointing more towards the background than the subject.", "content": "The careful arrangement of lights suggests a deliberate approach to portraiture, aiming for a flattering representation of the subject while maintaining a clean background."}

{"image_id": "965315.jpg", "original_comment": "Oh my.  I missed this one. You need to make this and the lightning one into HUGE prints on canvas.  I just bought a 58 X 64\" canvas of an anvil cloud.  7/8 of the shot is these big voluminous clouds that are charcoal and purple and then there is a tiny red line along the horizon.

{"image_id": "182892.jpg", "original_comment": "This looks less like infrared and more like an old, faded C-6 print.

{"image_id": "160054.jpg", "original_comment": "I like this photo.  The contrast between the emerging green growth and the dead leaves around it is stunning!  Good focus on subject.

{"image_id": "772769.jpg", "original_comment": "I really like this picture, but if I'm honest I think I'd like to have seen a tad more sharpness at some point in the image. I really like low DOF images but I think that works best where you can see a point of real sharpness. I have seen soft images that I really like, but they tend to use depth a bit more effectively and have more interesting colours; I'm thinking of the sort of images   produces. Still, this is a nice picture though and for all my nit-picking, I have given a 7.", "content": "The viewer believes that a focal point of sharpness could elevate the image's effectiveness, suggesting that it currently does not fully utilize the potential of depth and color."}
